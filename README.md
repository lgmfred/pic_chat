# PicChat

A chat application that can also upload images. It's a global chat where users can send messages and see the feed of messages update in real-time.

The messages are saved in a database with Ecto to demonstrate how to use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions with LiveViews.

## Running the application

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
